\begin{abstract}
In this report, we describe our named entity recognition system for Vietnamese, which is integrated in underthesea version 1.1.8.
Our system is open-source and available at \url{https://github.com/undertheseanlp/ner}

\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}

Named entity recognition (NER) is a fundamental task in natural language processing and information extraction.
It involves identifying noun phrases and classifying each of them into a predefined class.
In 1995, the 6th Message Understanding Conference (MUC) started evaluating NER systems for English, and in subsequent shared tasks of CoNLL 2002 and CoNLL 2003 conferences, language independent NER systems were evaluated.
In the evaluation tasks, four named entity types were considered, including names of persons, organizations, locations, and names of miscellaneous entities that do not belong to these three types.

In Vietnamese, there have been some shared tasks for evaluating NER systems, such as VLSP 2016, VLSP 2018.

Previously published systems for Vietnamese named entity recognition used machine learning methods such as Condition Random Field ~\cite{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-1803-08463}, MEMM ~\cite{DBLP:journals/corr/Le-Hong16}, BiLSTM-CNN-CRF ~\cite{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-1708-07241}, dynamic feature induction ~\cite{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-1801-01331}.

\section{System Description}

We takes some experiments in Conditional Random Fields.

\subsection{Conditional Random Fields}

Conditional Random Fields are a discriminative model, used for predicting sequences.
They use contextual information from previous labels, thus increasing the amount of information the model has to make a good prediction.

\subsection{Evaluation Measures}

We used Precision, Recall, F1 score as evaluation measures.

$$F_1 = \frac{2*P*R}{P + R}$$

where P (Precision), and R (Recall) are determined as follows:

$$P = \frac{{NE}_{true}}{NE_{sys}}$$

$$R = \frac{{NE}_{true}}{NE_{ref}}$$

where

$NE_{true}$: The number of NEs in gold data

$NE_{sys}$: The number of NEs in recognizing system

$NE_{true}$: The number of NEs which is correctly recognized by the system

\subsection{Results}

\section{Conclusion}

We have introduced our approach and its experimental result in named entity recognition for Vietnamese text.
